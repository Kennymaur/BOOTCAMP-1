# Caesar's Cipher Encryption

This project application writes an algorithm to encrypt and decrypt internal messages using Caesar's Cipher.

Caesar cipher is a form of cryptography also known as shift cipher, which is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. 

It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter of some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. 

The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

The transformation can be represented by aligning two alphabets; the cipher alphabet is the plain alphabet rotated left or right by some number of positions. 

When encrypting, a person looks up each letter of the message in the “plain” line and writes down the corresponding letter in the “cipher” line.

Deciphering is done in reverse.
